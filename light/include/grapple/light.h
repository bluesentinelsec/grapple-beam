/**
 * @file light.h
 * @brief Dynamic 2D lighting: day/night ambient, coloured lights, hard shadows.
 *
 * Original Grapple code (zlib), plain C over SDL3's renderer.
 *
 * Lighting is done on the GPU: when SDL's renderer is on OpenGL or OpenGL
 * ES, a fragment shader evaluates every light per pixel — smooth falloff,
 * cones, and shadows raymarched against the level's geometry. The GLSL is
 * compiled into the binary (see light/shaders/), so a game ships one
 * executable with no shader files beside it, and it is deliberately GLSL
 * 1.x so the same shader serves desktop GL, GLES and WebGL.
 *
 * Where there is no GL context — Metal, Direct3D, a software renderer in a
 * test — the same light map is built on the CPU from triangle fans
 * instead. The scene is lit either way; only the smoothness of the falloff
 * and the cost differ. Grapple_LightUsesShaders reports which path is
 * live.
 *
 * The model is the one 2D games have used for years: build a **light map**
 * (ambient colour, plus every light added on top), then multiply it over
 * the frame you already drew. Multiplying is what makes darkness dark —
 * an unlit pixel keeps its colour but loses its brightness, so a grey
 * floor at night reads as a dark grey floor rather than a black hole.
 *
 *     Grapple_LightBeginFrame(scene, camera_x, camera_y);
 *     Grapple_SetLightAmbient(scene, Grapple_DayNightAmbient(hour));
 *     Grapple_AddOccluderRect(scene, platform);      // walls block light
 *     Grapple_AddLight(scene, &torch);
 *     ... draw the world ...
 *     Grapple_RenderLighting(scene);                 // composite on top
 *
 * Lights and occluders are declared **every frame**, like immediate-mode
 * UI: there are no handles to keep in sync with your entities, and a light
 * that stops being submitted simply stops existing. The scene keeps only
 * what it needs to draw.
 *
 * Shadows are hard-edged by default, which is what a torch in a stone
 * corridor looks like; Grapple_SetLightShadowSoftness adds a penumbra on
 * the shader path.
 *
 * Everything is in **world coordinates**. The camera offset given to
 * Grapple_LightBeginFrame is applied when drawing, so a light attached
 * to an entity uses that entity's world position and nothing else.
