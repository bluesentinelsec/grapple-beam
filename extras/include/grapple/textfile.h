/**
 * @file textfile.h
 * @brief Reading a whole text file, in a form scripts can use.
 *
 * Original Grapple code (zlib). SDL_LoadFile hands back a void* plus a
 * size through an out-parameter — a pair that cannot cross a Lua or Ruby
 * binding boundary, so scripts had no way to read a file at all. This
 * returns a single NUL-terminated string instead: script bindings receive
 * it as an ordinary string (the copy is freed for them), and C callers own
 * the allocation and free it with SDL_free.
