# Modules

Every module is a static library with a `Grapple::` CMake alias target.
Link what you need; each page below covers the API surface, examples, and
the exact upstream provenance. Deeper reference material lives with the
code in each module's `README.md` and in the [`deps/`
ledgers](https://github.com/bluesentinelsec/grapple-beam/tree/main/deps),
which record every vendored version, checksum, deletion, and local fix.

| Target | Page | Provides |

| `Grapple::Cpp` | [C++](cpp.html) | Google-style RAII wrappers, `Status`/`Result`, generated full-API surface |

## Design rules shared by every module

- **Static first.** No module ever links a shared system library for its
  core function. If an upstream cannot be built static on a platform, it
  is not stubbed — it simply does not exist there (compile-time error, not
  a runtime surprise).
- **Pinned and ledgered.** Vendored code is imported at a specific
  release/commit with its SHA-256 recorded. Local changes are documented
  in `deps/<name>.md`, never silently mixed in.
- **Delete, don't stub.** Unsupported upstream features are removed from
  the headers, so misuse fails at compile time.
- **Tested where it runs.** Six CI platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows,
  ASan+UBSan, Android emulator, browser WebAssembly) plus an iOS
  XCFramework batch job.
