# GUI — `Grapple::GUI`

Nuklear v4.13.3 — the single-header immediate-mode GUI — with an original
SDL3 backend and a weighted grid layout helper. For graphical tools,
in-game UI, and general SDL applications; static everywhere SDL3 runs.

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_app PRIVATE Grapple::GUI)
```

## Frame loop

```c
#include <grapple/gui.h>
#include <grapple/gui_grid.h>

Grapple_Gui *gui = Grapple_CreateGui(renderer, NULL, 0, 0);  /* default font */

/* each frame: */
Grapple_GuiInputBegin(gui);
while (SDL_PollEvent(&ev)) { Grapple_GuiProcessEvent(gui, &ev); }
Grapple_GuiInputEnd(gui);

struct nk_context *ctx = Grapple_GuiContext(gui);
if (nk_begin(ctx, "Inspector", nk_rect(20, 20, 280, 340),
             NK_WINDOW_BORDER | NK_WINDOW_TITLE | NK_WINDOW_MOVABLE)) {
    nk_layout_row_dynamic(ctx, 0, 1);
    if (nk_button_label(ctx, "Respawn")) { respawn(); }
    nk_checkbox_label(ctx, "God mode", &god_mode);
    nk_slider_float(ctx, 0, &volume, 1.0f, 0.01f);
}
nk_end(ctx);

SDL_RenderClear(renderer);
/* ...draw the game... */
Grapple_GuiRender(gui);          /* UI composites over the frame */
SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);
```

`Grapple_GuiWantsInput(gui)` tells the game when the UI owns the
pointer. If you don't need the raw events yourself, the whole input
block collapses to one call:

```c
while (Grapple_GuiPumpEvents(gui)) {   /* false when the user quits */
    /* ...build the UI, draw, present... */
}
```

## From Lua and Ruby

The GUI is fully drivable from both script languages through the
generated bindings — `GrappleC.CreateGui`, `GrappleC.GuiContext`,
`GrappleC.GuiPumpEvents`, and the whole `NK.*` widget surface:

```lua
local gui = GrappleC.CreateGui(renderer, nil, 0, 0)
local ctx = GrappleC.GuiContext(gui)
while GrappleC.GuiPumpEvents(gui) do
  if NK.begin(ctx, "Tools", NK.rect(10, 10, 200, 300),
              NK.NK_WINDOW_BORDER + NK.NK_WINDOW_TITLE) then
    NK.layout_row_dynamic(ctx, 0, 1)
    if NK.button_label(ctx, "Bake") then bake() end
    local changed, value = NK.slider_float(ctx, 0, value, 1, 0.01)
  end
  NK.end_(ctx)
  GrappleC.GuiRender(gui)
  SDL.RenderPresent(renderer)
end
```

### High-DPI

Create the window with `SDL_WINDOW_HIGH_PIXEL_DENSITY` and the GUI adapts
automatically: the font is baked at the window's pixel density (so text
is crisp on Retina rather than half-size) and mouse input is scaled to
match, so hit-testing lines up. The GUI then lays out in **pixels**;
`Grapple_GuiScale(gui)` returns that density, so multiply your own
point-based sizes by it to stay density-independent:

```c
const float s = Grapple_GuiScale(gui);          /* 2.0 on Retina */
nk_layout_row_dynamic(ctx, 46.0f * s, 2);         /* 46pt row */
```

Windowless (software) renderers stay at 1.0, so headless tests and
non-Retina displays are unaffected.

### Grid layout from scripts

The full grid helper in `<grapple/gui_grid.h>` takes a caller-owned
struct and a `const float *` of column weights, neither of which can cross
a script boundary. A gui-owned mirror does the same job for every language:

```lua
GrappleC.GuiGridWeight(gui, 0, 1.0)   -- label column
GrappleC.GuiGridWeight(gui, 1, 2.0)   -- field column, twice as wide
GrappleC.GuiGridBeginOwned(gui, 2, 46 * scale)
GrappleC.GuiGridCellOwned(gui); NK.label(ctx, "Name:", NK.NK_TEXT_LEFT)
GrappleC.GuiGridCellOwned(gui); NK.button_label(ctx, "Browse")
GrappleC.GuiGridEndOwned(gui)
```

Weights default to 1 (equal columns) and reset after each grid.

### Images

`Grapple_GuiImage(gui, texture, mode)` shows an `SDL_Texture` in the next
widget slot. Nuklear's own `nk_image` takes a struct whose handle is a
union — unreachable from a script — and only ever stretches; this takes the
texture directly and applies a sizing mode:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `GRAPPLE_GUI_IMAGE_STRETCH` | fills the slot, ignoring aspect ratio |
| `GRAPPLE_GUI_IMAGE_ZOOM` | largest fit inside, aspect preserved |
| `GRAPPLE_GUI_IMAGE_FILL` | covers the slot, aspect preserved, cropped |
| `GRAPPLE_GUI_IMAGE_CENTER` | native size, centred |

```c
nk_layout_row_dynamic(ctx, 380.0f * scale, 1);
Grapple_GuiImage(gui, texture, GRAPPLE_GUI_IMAGE_ZOOM);
```

Load textures with [Grapple::Image](image.html) (`IMG_LoadTexture`), or
from a mounted [VFS](vfs.html) archive. Modes that can overflow the slot are
scissored to it, so an image never spills onto neighbouring widgets.

### Drawing textures yourself

`Grapple_GuiImage` takes a layout slot, which is right for a picture in a
form and wrong for a game panel: an inventory slot draws a background, an
icon and a stack count inside **one** rectangle, and the click is handled by
an invisible button occupying that same slot. For those, measure the
rectangle and draw into it:

```c
const struct nk_rect bounds = nk_widget_bounds(ctx);
const SDL_FRect icon = {bounds.x + 6, bounds.y + 6, bounds.w - 12, bounds.h - 24};
Grapple_GuiDrawTexture(gui, texture, icon, GRAPPLE_GUI_IMAGE_ZOOM);
nk_button_label(ctx, "");   /* the same slot, now handling input */
```

`Grapple_GuiDrawTexture` paints into the current window's canvas, so it is
clipped and layered with that window, and it does not advance the layout.

For something that must float above *every* panel — the icon under the
cursor during a drag — use `Grapple_GuiDrawTextureOverlay`. It queues the
draw and flushes it after the whole GUI has rendered, in call order.
Nuklear's own overlay buffer cannot be used for this: it is re-initialised
for the mouse cursor on every frame.

```c
if (dragging) {
    const SDL_FRect at = {mouse_x - 24, mouse_y - 24, 48, 48};
    Grapple_GuiDrawTextureOverlay(gui, icon, at, GRAPPLE_GUI_IMAGE_ZOOM);
}
```

The queue is emptied each frame, so call it every frame the ghost should be
visible; up to `GRAPPLE_GUI_MAX_OVERLAYS` draws per frame.

### What the frame cost

`Grapple_GuiDrawCommandCount(gui)` and `Grapple_GuiMemoryUsed(gui)`
report the last rendered frame — the two numbers a debug overlay wants.
Hiding a panel visibly drops both, which makes them useful for finding the
panel that is quietly expensive.

### Glyph ranges, and why an em dash renders as a box

A font atlas is rasterised **once**, when the GUI is created, so the glyph
range chosen there decides for the GUI's lifetime what text can be drawn.
Nuklear's default stops at U+00FF, which is why an em dash, a curly quote
or an arrow pasted into a label comes out as the missing-glyph box no
matter which font you supply.

```c
gui = Grapple_CreateGuiWithGlyphs(renderer, font, font_len, 18.0f,
                                    GRAPPLE_GUI_GLYPHS_PUNCTUATION);
```

`GRAPPLE_GUI_GLYPHS_PUNCTUATION` adds dashes, quotes, bullets, ellipsis,
arrows and currency to Latin-1 — what UI text actually contains.
`CYRILLIC`, `CHINESE` and `KOREAN` are also available, and are the only way
to use the GUI for those scripts. Wider ranges cost atlas space and baking
time, so pick the narrowest that covers your strings, and pair anything
above Latin-1 with a font that actually has the glyphs: the built-in
default font is ASCII.

### Tooltips

`Grapple_GuiTooltip(gui, text)` shows hover text for the **next** widget
with desktop timing: it appears only after the pointer has rested on that
widget, and hides again the moment the pointer moves. Nuklear's own
`nk_tooltip` draws immediately and stays up for as long as the pointer is
inside the widget, which is not how tooltips behave.

```c
Grapple_GuiTooltip(gui, "Create a new document");
nk_button_label(ctx, "New");
```

The dwell defaults to 1000 ms; `Grapple_GuiSetTooltipDelay(gui, ms)`
changes it (0 shows immediately) and `Grapple_GuiTooltipDelay` reads it
back. The call returns true on frames where the tooltip is displayed.

### File buttons that work in every browser

`Grapple_ShowOpenFileDialog` is enough on desktop, but on the web a picker
or a download only opens from inside the *real* click handler. An SDL app
sees a click one frame later, by which time Safari has withdrawn permission
— Firefox is laxer, which is why a dialog can appear to work until someone
tries it in Safari. The fix is to let the browser's own elements take the
click, so the GUI offers two widgets that are ordinary buttons on desktop
and transparent DOM overlays on the web:

```c
/* Open: the picker's result arrives through the usual dialog state machine. */
Grapple_GuiOpenFileButton(gui, "Open", "Text files", "txt");
if (Grapple_DialogStatus() == GRAPPLE_DIALOG_ACCEPTED) {
    load(Grapple_DialogPath());
    Grapple_DialogReset();
}

/* Save: pass the document's current bytes every frame — the download link
   has to hold them before the click, not after it. */
if (Grapple_GuiSaveFileButton(gui, "Save", "untitled.txt", body, len)) {
    printf("saved to %s\n", Grapple_GuiSavedPath(gui));
}
```

The save button shows the native save dialog on desktop and writes the file
itself once a path is chosen, which takes a few frames — keep calling it
with the same arguments until it returns true. On the web the bytes are
re-blobbed only when they change, so serialising each frame is cheap.

Two consequences of the overlay: the browser click never reaches Nuklear, so
these buttons do not show hover or press shading on the web, and one of each
is supported at a time — enough for a File menu, and all a modal picker can
be. The overlay is hidden automatically on any frame that does not draw the
button, so it never swallows clicks meant for other widgets.

### Two things immediate mode will catch you with

**A window's rectangle is read once.** `nk_begin` uses the rect you pass
only when it *creates* the window; afterwards the window owns its geometry,
which is exactly what makes panels movable and resizable. So panels do not
re-flow when the SDL window is resized unless you push the new bounds in:

```c
if (width != last_width || height != last_height) {
    nk_window_set_bounds(ctx, "Inventory", new_area);   /* only on resize */
}
```

Doing it every frame instead would pin the window and the user could never
move it.

**`nk_item_is_any_active` is not "is a text field focused".** It is true
whenever any panel is up, so gating keyboard navigation on it swallows every
key forever. The flag you want is the `NK_EDIT_ACTIVE` bit that
`nk_edit_string` returns for the field that has focus:

```c
const nk_flags state = nk_edit_string(ctx, NK_EDIT_FIELD, buf, &len, cap,
                                      nk_filter_default);
text_focused |= (state & NK_EDIT_ACTIVE) != 0;
```

### Keyboard and theming from scripts

`Grapple_GuiKeyPressed(gui, SDL_SCANCODE_ESCAPE)` reports keys seen
during the last pump — SDL's keyboard-state API returns a raw array that
cannot cross a binding boundary, so this is how scripts implement
"Escape quits". `Grapple_GuiPushStyleColor` / `PopStyleColor` theme the
window background, text, buttons and header for the same reason:
Nuklear's own style stack takes union-typed style items.

```lua
GrappleC.GuiPushStyleColor(gui, GrappleC.GRAPPLE_GUI_COLOR_WINDOW_BACKGROUND,
                             {r = 28, g = 30, b = 38, a = 255})
-- ...build the window...
GrappleC.GuiPopStyleColor(gui, 1)
```

`GuiPumpEvents` exists because `SDL_Event` is a union and cannot cross a
script boundary — it is the supported way to feed input to the GUI from
Lua and Ruby. Three idioms to know: `nk_bool` crosses as a real boolean
(use truthiness, not `~= 0` — `0` is truthy in both languages),
out-parameters come back as extra return values, and enum constants are
registered by name (`NK.NK_WINDOW_TITLE`). The weighted grid helper
below stays C/C++-only: it takes a `const float *` weights array and a
caller-owned struct, so scripts use Nuklear's native
`layout_row_begin`/`push`/`end` instead. The full Nuklear widget set is available through the context:
buttons, check/radio, sliders, progress, spinboxes, single/multi-line
edit with clipboard, combos, lists, trees, menus, popups, tooltips,
charts, color picker. Always include `<grapple/nuklear.h>` (never the
raw header) so every translation unit sees the pinned configuration.

## Grid layout — no hard-coded coordinates

Column weights declared once; widgets placed cell by cell with auto-wrap
and spans. Widths are weight-proportional to the window, so the same
code lays out correctly at any display size:

```c
static const float weights[] = {1, 2};        /* label : field = 1 : 2 */
Grapple_GuiGrid grid;
Grapple_GuiGridBegin(ctx, &grid, 2, weights, 0);  /* 0 = font-based rows */

Grapple_GuiGridCell(&grid);  nk_label(ctx, "Name:", NK_TEXT_LEFT);
Grapple_GuiGridCell(&grid);  nk_edit_string_zero_terminated(ctx, NK_EDIT_FIELD,
                                                              name, sizeof(name),
                                                              nk_filter_default);
Grapple_GuiGridCellSpan(&grid, 2);  nk_button_label(ctx, "Apply");
Grapple_GuiGridEnd(&grid);
```

Tests run fully headless: pixel readback proves rendering, fabricated
SDL events drive clicks, toggles, a real slider drag, and UTF-8 text
entry.
