"""Load the shared library the way something that is not C++ would.

    python3 test_shared_library.py <path-to-library> [--cxx]

This is the test the shared libraries exist for. A C++ consumer proves very
little about them: it links through the same toolchain that built them, with
the same headers, and never asks whether the symbols are *exported*. Python
asks nothing of the build system — it opens the file, looks up names, and
calls them — which is exactly what a plugin host, a C# binding or a Zig
project does.

It matters that this **calls** and does not merely load. A library that
exports nothing loads perfectly well and fails at the first lookup; on
Windows a DLL built without exports is a valid DLL. Checking `CDLL(path)`
succeeded would pass in exactly the case worth catching.

The engine is driven through the heap builders rather than a struct, because
a struct means agreeing on layout across a language boundary and the builders
mean agreeing on nothing.
