# cJSON / tomlc99 / libyaml (vendored under `formats/`)

All three are plain C, MIT-licensed, and have zero external dependencies —
they don't even use SDL — so `Grapple::Formats` is inherently
static-link friendly on every platform including web. Native upstream APIs
are exposed directly (`<cJSON.h>`, `<toml.h>`, `<yaml.h>`).

## What was deleted (not imported)

Build systems, test suites, fuzz corpora, docs, packaging metadata from all
three — sources, public headers, and licenses only.

## Local modifications

None. All three passed the malformed-input fuzzing (truncations + bit
flips) under ASan+UBSan without findings.
