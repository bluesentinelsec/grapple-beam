The permanent glyph backend for `Grapple::TTF` (decision record in
`deps/SDL3_ttf.md`; the stb_truetype alternative was dropped from scope). Built static and **minimal** — every optional dependency
disabled so it contributes zero shared-library dependencies:

- `FT_DISABLE_ZLIB` (uses FreeType's internal zlib copy)
- `FT_DISABLE_BZIP2`, `FT_DISABLE_PNG`, `FT_DISABLE_HARFBUZZ`,
  `FT_DISABLE_BROTLI`

The link audit (`scripts/link_audit.py`) verifies this on every desktop CI
run.

**Attribution requirement (FTL):** products shipping this library must
acknowledge FreeType in their documentation/credits, e.g.:

> Portions of this software are copyright © The FreeType Project
> (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.

Consumers of Grapple::TTF inherit this obligation; it is called out in the
extension's README.

Update procedure: bump the URL + `URL_HASH` in `cmake/Dependencies.cmake`,
update this file, and let the full CI matrix validate.
