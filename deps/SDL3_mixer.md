| API generation | The redesigned **`MIX_*`** API (what 3.2.4 ships) |

## What was taken

- `src/` core: `SDL_mixer.c`, metadata tags, spatialization, internal headers.
- Static-friendly decoders (each vendored single-file or pure C, in-tree):
  `decoder_wav.c`, `decoder_aiff.c`, `decoder_au.c`, `decoder_voc.c`,
  `decoder_raw.c`, `decoder_sinewave.c`, `decoder_stb_vorbis.c` (+
  `src/stb_vorbis/`), `decoder_drmp3.c` / `decoder_drflac.c` (+
  `src/dr_libs/`), `decoder_timidity.c` (+ `src/timidity/` incl. its
  COPYING).
- `include/SDL3_mixer/`, `LICENSE.txt`.

## What was deleted (not imported)

- Decoders requiring external shared/heavy libraries (no-stubs — the decoder
  table is `#ifdef`-gated upstream, so removal needed no dispatch surgery):
  `decoder_flac.c` (libFLAC), `decoder_vorbis.c` (libvorbisfile),
  `decoder_mpg123.c` (mpg123), `decoder_opus.c` (opus/opusfile),
  `decoder_wavpack.c` (WavPack), `decoder_gme.c` (game-music-emu),
  `decoder_xmp.c` (libxmp — trackers are out of scope by decision),
  `decoder_fluidsynth.c` (FluidSynth — MIDI is covered statically by
  TiMidity).
- `external/` submodule stubs, `.github/`, `cmake/`, `CMakeLists.txt`,
  `build-scripts/`, `test/`, `examples/`, `docs/`, IDE trees, shared-library
  export machinery (`genexports.py`, `.exports`, `.sym`, `version.rc`).

## Format coverage (the games-90%)

Enabled: **WAV, OGG Vorbis, MP3, FLAC** (the big four), plus AIFF, AU, VOC,
RAW, generated sine waves, and **MIDI** via statically linked TiMidity.
TiMidity needs GUS patch data at runtime; the repo ships an original
**generated** GM patch set (`modules/mixer/gm-patches/`, built by
`scripts/gen_gus_patches.py` — no third-party samples, zlib). Without
patches, MIDI loads fail cleanly with zero link-time cost.

## Local modifications

None yet (decoder selection is entirely build-level).

Test corpus: fully **synthesized** by `scripts/gen_test_audio.py`
(deterministic chiptune loop + sfx, encoded to every enabled format with
ffmpeg) — no external recordings, no licensing questions. See
`tests/mixer/assets/README.md`.
