## What was taken

`Headers/` and `Source/` plus `LICENSE`. Tests, tools, and build system
were not imported.

## Build configuration

Unity build: the single `Source/SheenBidi.c` TU with
`SB_CONFIG_UNITY=1`, compiled inside `Grapple_TTF` with
`Headers/` and `Source/` on the private include path.

## Why

Implements the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UAX #9). HarfBuzz
shapes one directional run at a time; SheenBidi splits mixed
right-to-left / left-to-right paragraphs into those runs. Exposed
through the original `<grapple/bidi.h>` helper
(`Grapple_BidiItemize`, `Grapple_BidiBaseIsRTL`), which returns
visual-order runs ready to feed `TTF_SetTextDirection`.

Chosen over FriBidi specifically for licensing: FriBidi is LGPL, which
is burdensome for statically linked closed-source games; SheenBidi is
Apache-2.0 and purpose-built for embedding.
