 *
 *   [1] clamp    a stall is not a slow frame; drop the time
 *   [2] smooth   snap the measured delta onto the display's cadence
 *   [3] step     advance the simulation in exact, equal steps
 *   [4] alpha    render *between* steps, so the display rate and the
 *                simulation rate need not agree
