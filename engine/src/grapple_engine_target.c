/*
 * grapple_engine_target.c — the offscreen frame.
 * Original Grapple code (zlib).
 *
 * Render scale draws the frame at a fraction of the window's resolution and
 * lets the display scale it up, which needs somewhere to draw it — this
 * file is that somewhere.
 *
 * A game at render_scale 1.0 pays nothing: Begin and End do nothing at all
 * and the loop draws directly to the window exactly as it did before this
 * file existed. Post-processing is separate: it copies the finished frame
 * out of the framebuffer, so it works with or without a target here.
 *
 * The logical presentation is the subtle part. SDL applies it to whatever
 * the current render target is, so pointing the renderer at a texture of a
 * different size would silently change the scale the game draws at. The
 * target is therefore created at the *pixel* size the frame would have had,
 * scaled — and the logical presentation is re-applied against it, so design
 * coordinates keep meaning the same thing whatever the render scale is.
