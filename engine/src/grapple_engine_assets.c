/*
 * grapple_engine_assets.c — the asset cache and its worker pool.
 * Original Grapple code (zlib).
 *
 * The shape is forced by one fact: decoding a PNG is pure computation and
 * can happen anywhere, but creating an SDL_Texture touches the renderer,
 * and SDL's renderer belongs to the thread that made it. So:
 *
 *     worker threads   VFS read -> decode -> SDL_Surface
 *     main thread      SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface -> SDL_Texture
 *
 * and the main-thread half is time-sliced, because forty textures
 * finishing together would otherwise upload forty textures in one frame and
 * hitch at exactly the moment a loading bar is meant to be reassuring
 * somebody.
 *
 * One mutex guards the whole table. That is not laziness: the critical
 * sections are a few pointer swaps, the contention is two workers and a
 * main thread, and a finer-grained scheme would buy nothing measurable
 * while being much easier to get wrong.
