/**
 * @file engine_render.h
 * @brief Engine-owned drawing: a sprite per actor, z-ordered and culled.
 *
 * Original Grapple code (zlib).
 *
 * Give an actor a sprite and the engine draws it — in the right order,
 * only if it is on screen, at the interpolated position, through whichever
 * camera you hand it:
 *
 *     Grapple_Sprite sprite = Grapple_SpriteDefault();
 *     sprite.texture = goblin_texture;
 *     sprite.width = 64.0f;
 *     sprite.height = 64.0f;
 *     sprite.layer = LAYER_ACTORS;
 *     Grapple_ActorSetSprite(actor, &sprite);
 *
 *     // in the render hook
 *     Grapple_RenderWorld(engine, &camera, alpha);
 *
 * That is the whole loop for a 2D game. What the engine is doing on your
 * behalf, and why each piece is worth having in the engine rather than in
 * every game:
 *
 *   **Ordering.** Draw order is the difference between a character standing
 *   in front of a tree and inside it. Sorting per frame by an explicit
 *   layer, and optionally by world Y within it, is the thing every 2D game
 *   needs and no two hand-rolled versions agree on.
 *
 *   **Culling.** A level is bigger than the screen — that is what a camera
 *   is for — so most of it must not be drawn. Culling against the camera's
 *   visible rectangle turns "draw the level" from O(level) into O(screen).
 *
 *   **Interpolation.** Sprites are drawn at
 *   Grapple_ActorRenderTransform, so motion is smooth without any game
 *   writing its own `previous_x`.
 *
 * The engine does **not** load textures. A sprite holds an `SDL_Texture *`
 * the game made however it liked; asset streaming is its own subsystem.
 * Drawing what you are given and fetching what you asked for are different
 * jobs with different failure modes, and merging them makes both worse.
