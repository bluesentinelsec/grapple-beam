/**
 * @file engine_script.h
 * @brief The loop contract for scripts: hooks, or drive it yourself.
 *
 * Original Grapple code (zlib).
 *
 * A generated binding can call any function that takes numbers and handles.
 * What it cannot do is hand C a function pointer and a `void *user`, which
 * is exactly what the engine's hooks are — so this is the bridge, and it is
 * the only hand-written part of the script surface.
 *
 * ### Two ways to own the frame, and you pick
 *
 * **The opinionated loop** is the default and what most games should use.
 * The script registers handlers and hands the loop over; the engine does
 * the fixed tick, the interpolation, the frame limiter and the asset pump,
 * and calls back into script at the documented points:
 *
 *     -- Lua
 *     GrappleC.OnFixedUpdate(engine, function(step) player:move(step) end)
 *     GrappleC.OnRender(engine, function(alpha) draw(alpha) end)
 *     GrappleC.Run(engine)           -- returns when the game quits
 *
 * **Your own loop** is opt-in, for a script that wants the frame itself —
 * a tool, a test, an unusual integration. Nothing is registered; the script
 * calls the tick:
 *
 *     while GrappleC.EngineTick(engine) do
 *       -- everything between frames is yours
 *     end
 *
 * The contract is that simple: **if you registered handlers, call Run; if
 * you did not, call EngineTick yourself.** Both drive the same loop —
 * `Run` is a loop around `EngineTick` — so the fixed timestep, the
 * interpolation alpha and the frame pacing are identical either way. What
 * differs is only who owns the `while`.
 *
 * Mixing them is refused rather than half-working: registering a handler
 * and then driving the loop by hand would call the handlers anyway, from a
 * place the script did not expect. See Grapple_ScriptHasHandlers.

/**
 * ### Scenes from a script
 *
 * A scene is defined by its callbacks — that is the whole of what makes a
 * title screen different from a level — so unlike the other definitions in
 * this engine, a builder alone would produce a scene that does nothing.
 * It needs the same bridge the game hooks got, one level down.
 *
 * A script defines a scene **by name**, once, and then pushes it by that
 * name:
 *
 *     GrappleC.SceneDefine(engine, "level")
 *     GrappleC.SceneOn(engine, "level", "load",  function(scene) ... end)
 *     GrappleC.SceneOn(engine, "level", "render", function(scene, alpha) ... end)
 *     GrappleC.ScriptScenePush(engine, "level")
 *
 * The name is the identity, not a pointer, which is what makes this work
 * from a script at all: the engine copies a definition when it pushes one,
 * so a C game may pass a local and forget it, while a script has nowhere to
 * keep a struct in the first place. A name outlives both.
 *
 * Every callback receives the scene, so one definition can back several
 * live scenes and tell them apart — a script keeps per-scene data in a
 * table keyed by the scene, the way C uses Grapple_SceneState.
