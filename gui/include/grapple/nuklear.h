/**
 * @file nuklear.h
 * @brief The vendored Nuklear header with this project's configuration.
 *
 * Include THIS header (not the raw vendored one) so every translation unit
 * sees the same NK_INCLUDE_* configuration that the library was compiled
 * with — mismatched defines across TUs are the classic single-header bug.
 * The implementation lives in exactly one TU inside Grapple::GUI.
 *
 * Nuklear is vendored as-is (v4.13.3, dual MIT/public-domain; provenance
 * in deps/nuklear.md). See the upstream docs for the full immediate-mode
 * API: https://immediate-mode-ui.github.io/Nuklear/

/* Nuklear's built-in double->string conversion is documented upstream as
 * "imprecise and possibly unsafe"; it emits exponent form for ordinary
 * values, which its own %f formatter then mis-parses (40.0 renders as
 * "4"). Route conversion through SDL's printf, which is always present
 * here, so nk_labelf/nk_text formatting is correct. */
