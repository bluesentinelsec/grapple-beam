"""Audit the script surface for handles no script can produce.

    python3 tools/audit_script_surface.py [--deps build/debug/_deps]

A bound function taking a handle is only callable if some *other* bound
function hands that handle back. Anything else is bound but
unconstructible: it appears in SCRIPT_API.md, it autocompletes, and it
cannot be called — a whole feature that looks supported and is not.

That is what SDL_Event was. PollEvent was bound from the day SDL was
parsed, and no script could poll an event, because SDL_PollEvent fills a
struct the caller allocates and a script has no stack to allocate one on.
The coverage report counted it as bound, because it is.

The fix each time is the same and cheap: a create/destroy pair plus
scalar setters, which the generator already classifies as an owned
resource. See engine_config.h.

Not every entry here is a bug. Some handles are legitimately borrowed —
mog_server_request is handed to a request callback and has no meaning
outside one — and some belong to APIs nobody should drive from a script.
The point of the audit is that the decision is *visible* rather than
discovered by somebody writing a game.
