"""Nuklear's bound surface must be its public API and nothing below it.

Nuklear is a single-header library: the widgets a game calls and the
machinery underneath them live in the same file, separated only by how
they are declared. `NK_API` is the public surface; `NK_LIB` and
`NK_INTERN` are the implementation, and binding those would hand a script
the guts of the layout engine — a pool, a page, a command buffer's write
head — where any mistake is a corrupt context rather than an error.

The parser only accepts NK_API, so this holds by construction. That is
exactly the kind of property that breaks quietly when someone widens a
regex, hence a test rather than a comment.

Two things are checked, because "bound" means two different things:

  functions   every bound nk_* function is declared NK_API
  structs     only value types a public signature actually passes get
              field access. Everything else stays an opaque handle: a
              script may hold it and give it back, and cannot read or
              write a field of it.

Run standalone or under ctest; exits non-zero with the offenders named.
