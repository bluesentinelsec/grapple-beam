/**
 * @file engine_text.h
 * @brief Localisation: string tables, with English as the fallback.
 *
 * Original Grapple code (zlib).
 *
 * Game code asks for a key and gets a string in whatever language is
 * current:
 *
 *     DrawText(Grapple_Text(engine, "menu.start"));
 *     DrawText(Grapple_TextFormat(engine, "hud.score", score));
 *
 * with the tables shipped as TOML in the media archive:
 *
 *     # media/lang/fr.toml
 *     [strings]
 *     "menu.start" = "Commencer"
 *     "hud.score" = "Score : %d"
 *
 * ### A missing translation falls back rather than disappearing
 *
 * If a key is absent from the current language, the engine returns the
 * **English** string; if it is absent from that too, it returns the **key
 * itself**. Both are deliberate.
 *
 * A game shipping a half-finished translation should show English for the
 * gaps, not blanks — a blank button is indistinguishable from a bug, and
 * translators work from partial files by definition. And a key with no
 * entry anywhere renders as `menu.start`, which is ugly on purpose: it is
 * immediately obvious in a screenshot, and it names the thing that needs
 * fixing.
 *
 * ### Keys, not English text, are the identifiers
 *
 * The alternative — keying off the English string — means every typo fix in
 * English silently breaks every translation. Keys cost a little readability
 * at the call site and buy the ability to edit English freely.
